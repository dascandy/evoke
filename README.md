Evoke

Evoke is the simple solution to the complicated problem of building software for C++ and related languages.

# Build Instructions

Right now it is not available as a package for common operating systems yet. To install it, you will need to compile it from source.

It requires Boost 1.64 or higher; it uses boost.process and boost.interprocess. To compile, download the full source tree and type `make` in the place you downloaded it to. Then, run `bin/evoke_make` to build evoke using itself. When this succeeds, you will have a `bin/evoke` that does the same thing, but is built with Evoke. Copy this to `~/bin/evoke` for a user-local installation or to `/usr/local/bin/evoke` for a system-wide installation.

```console
mkdir build && cd build  # create build directory
cmake ..  # generate build system
cmake --build .  # build evoke
```

Or, building with Evoke (if you somehow have it already),

```console
evoke
```

# Usage

To use evoke, create a folder that is named after your project target, and create a `src` or `include` folder inside that. Evoke recognizes a `src` or `include` folder as the root of a component, and will name it after the directory tree navigated to get to it. For example, if you have a folder called `hello/src` it will create a component called `hello`, and if your folder is called `thirdparty/catch/include` it will create a component called `thirdparty.catch`.

Evoke reads all the source code found inside components this way and analyzes their dependencies through use of `#include` and `import` statements. It derives the full dependency tree of the source tree and uses it to determine which components will become a library and which will become an executable. Its rule is that any component *with* a link coming from something else must be a library (because something else is including its files), and any component *without* a link coming from something else must be an executable. To compile, simply type `evoke` at the root of your project and it will compile the full set of source files with appropriate flags for the current version of c++ into libraries and executables.

# Development

Everybody is free to help with Evoke development. The simpler things that need to be done are to create issues for things you would like it to do, or for asking help when it does not do what you want it to. You can join the discord at https://includecpp.org . If you want to do more, there are a few open issues already that require a bit more knowledge and time investment, like porting it to run on Windows or OSX.

## Short Term Goals

Next few milestones (in any order):
- Have easy imports for evoke-built projects in XCode, MSVC, VS Code and CLion.
- Get to 30% test coverage. Not to aim for a number, but to have at least some target.
- Full integration with at least one package manager - export of needed file list, and import of package inputs. 

v1.0 will be hit when:

- All of the above
- Packaged & shipped as DEB in Debian (ie, set up to...)
- Packaged & shipped as installer for Windows (same)
- Packaged & shipped as DMG for MacOS (same)
- Available in OS package managers where they exist (brew/macports for MacOS and apt/snap for Ubuntu/Debian) (same)

## Clang Format

Formatting of all source files is done using ClangFormat. Rules for it are specified in .clang-format file in the root of the repository.

**Path:** /.clang-format

**Requires:** [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) version 6.0
